#underbar

This is my re-implementation of a core part of the most used underscorejs
functions. It includes my implementation of common functions as map, each and
reduce, which replace the vast majority of for-loops as well as higher-order
functions such as once, memoize and throttle, which use closures to provide
complex functionality.

This is part of Hack Reactorâ€™s curriculum.
